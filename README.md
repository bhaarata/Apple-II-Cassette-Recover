### Description

Apple-II-Cassette-Recover attempts to recover all the data from a WAVE format image
of a cassette tape in Apple ][ SAVE format.

`{ HEADER SYNC DATA } ...`

It does not try to preserve non-data areas of the input wave file, but just extracts
them. It creates a new clean WAVE file, with a completely rebuilt tape signal.
